  <h1>Miloš Crnjanski</h1>
  <p>Miloš Crnjanski <em>(October 1893 – 30 November 1977)</em> was a poet of the expressionist wing of Serbian modernism, author, and a diplomat.
From his beginnings as a journalist whose social-political stance was at one moment openly opposed to freedom and progress, he gradually arose to become a poet and romanticist.

   Serbia and Serbian heritage in his soul as a precious relic.</p>
